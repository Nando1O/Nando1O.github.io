I am a computer science major at CSUF and I'm graduating in the year 2028


## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5 Part 1: 
I liked learning more on how to use cout and cin for numbers and calculating answers with the use of them both. Though it was simple coding to do, it was very nice to know the basics of taking inputs from the user and making them into outputs of your choosing based on what you code.

Lab 6 Part 1:
This lab was the lab introducing the command line and being able to take inputs from it to then use it within the program. I like the simplicity and being able to have another way to get inputs instead of just cout and cin. Though a bit more complex, it allows more difficult things to be done like reading files.

Lab 9 Part 2:
Part 2 had two different areas, one to make the secret, and the other to find the secret, the only thing linking them was the file containing the secret number to be used. I enjoyed this part of the lab as it helped make the files more understable and why coders use them, overall it was a fun lab to do.
